# brainfrick

In this repo you'll find an assortment of Brainf*ck interpreters written in different programming languages.

I consider Brainf*ck interpreters to be a pretty cool toy-project for learning the basics of any language, as they're borderline trivial to implement (nevermind the ocassional off-by-one errors) and make you explore a good handful of fundamental constructs for any language (Control flow, file I/O, buffers, error handling, ...). I decided to document all of them here since I thought it could be a fun collection to make.

Let this repo serve as a chronicle of sorts, giving hints as to what language I might have been exploring at any given time.
